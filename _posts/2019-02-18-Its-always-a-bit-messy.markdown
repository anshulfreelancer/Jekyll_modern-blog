Little kids are masters of the moment. They love the way it feels when they smear paint on paper or when they get to scribble on the wall. They’re neither self-conscious about what they are doing nor they’re bothered about creating a finished product.

My twin toddlers have great love for paints, colors, and crayons. It all started with scribblings on the walls. There was a time when all the walls in the house had their marks. It was a task for me to get the wall back in shape. However, this freedom to scribble resulted in developing a firm grip on brushes and pencils with a nuanced understanding of colors. Above all it gave wings to their imagination.

Inspiring creativity in kids is very important. Since my twins first picked up the crayon, this is what I have learned about fueling their unbound inquisitiveness —

1.First of all, be prepared for a mess. What looks mess to you, is a workshop with multiple tools for the kids. Set up an art space where kids can be free to experiment and get messy.

2.Avoid giving instructions. Allow them to paint or draw their own imagination. Easier to preach, hard to practice.

3.Explore your child’s creation by asking her how she made it. Let her explain why she enjoyed doing it.

4.Whenever your child finishes a piece, don’t suggest additions or changes. Just let it be. It’s important for a child to feel what she has created is enough even if it’s just a dot on the canvas.

Art is as natural as sunshine and as vital as nourishment. Keep inspiring creativity in your kids!

Love,
Shruti!
