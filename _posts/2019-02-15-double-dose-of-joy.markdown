Lucky is a pregnancy that brings two babies into the world. 

There is something strikingly gorgeous about twin babies. Identical twins are a medical mystery and as a mother of these little miracles everyday feels really special. Being mother to twins is however a roller coaster ride of emotions. Dizzying ups and scary downs. Plenty of moments that make you feel lucky and blessed. And plenty of challenging times that make you panic and feel helpless.

Ever since I first held the babies in my arms I started telling myself that the journey ahead is going be tough but I shall do well. I remember the days when I wished to be at two places at one time. I wished I was a superwoman so that I could meet the needs of both the girls at the same time.

There were times when the girls were cranky and both needed their mommy at the same to soothe them. The challenges mounted as the girls started moving and it was tough to contain them at one place. Imagine two babies crawling in different directions then and two enthusiastic toddlers running in different directions now. Things haven’t changed much in last 3 years. My girls are faster than one would imagine and they are always ready with their new and exciting ways to freak me out.

ME time had always been a distant dream. The only ones I had was going to the wash room and having a shower. This has relaxed a bit since the girls started their preschool.

Throughout the last 3 years of raising my girls I have been self-assessing as to how good a Mom I am. I had been quite harsh on myself and felt guilty for missing the timeline for potty training, for zero diaper time, for zero screen time, and several such to do’s. However, during this process I have also made peace with the fact that it’s practically not possible to do everything for both the babies at the same time. So it pretty ok when one baby is going to lie down and cry while I attend to the other one.

In spite of these growing challenges with every passing day, when I walk holding hands with two toddlers - one on the left and one on the right, I feel no less than a Superwoman. When I lie down on the bed, sandwiched between both of them, each urging me to face her side, I find it tough but I do fairly well. The endless cuddles on the couch with mommy in the middle fill me with the kind of energy that would last a lifetime. It’s a story of double hugs, double kisses, double delight, and double blessing. Life just doesn’t get any better than this!
